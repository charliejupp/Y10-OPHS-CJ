#vairibles vs constants
#vairibles are declared in titlecase
#constants are declared in capitals 

#examples of vairibles 

team1name ="charlies stars"
team2name = "abra kebabra"

#vairlibles have a useful name 
#vairibles store a value(can change)
#vairibles can not start with a number 
#e.g. 1teamname ="abra kebabra"
#this will cause a sytax error 

#vairible cannot have a space in the name
#e.g team name =" abra kebabra "
#this will be a syntax error

#this is a example of a constant
FREETHROW=1
TWOPOINTER=2
THREEPOINTER =3
#the values in a constant do not change
